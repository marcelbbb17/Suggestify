 - Improve current recommender system by using more complex algorithms 
 - Allow users to validate their recommendation to determine whether a recommendation is good or not 
 Next Steps:
 - Integrate the current recommender system to the frontend 
 - Create a feedback page/option to allow users to give feedback on recommendations
 - Improve current recommender system 

 24/02/2025 - 02/03/2025
 Activities: 
 - Implemented a recommendation page for displaying movie recommendations with filtering capabilities  
 - Created a responsive landing page with animated elements
 - Stored recommendations in the database to prevent excessive API calls
 Challenges: 
 - Understanding and using CSS animation 
 - Fixing a database deadlock issue causing the /recommend endpoint to be called twice whenever user navigated to the recommendation page
 Next Steps:
 - Creating a feedback page for recommendations
 - Start writing my dissertation, starting with the introduction 
 - Create a watchlist page where user can add movies they've watched 

03/03/2025 - 07/04/2025
Activities:
- Implemented watchlist functionality
- Implemented movie page
- Implemented movie detail page
Challenges:
- Preventing exposure of the TMDB API key on frontend when calling for metadata using the proxy endpoint
- UI/UX design of each implemented page, ensuring visual appeal
- Creating responsive design for the movie detail page so it displays correctly when window is resized (still working on this)
- Resolving movie_id mismatches between my database and TMDB API that cause movies retrieved from the database to display incorrectly in the frontend due to different IDs
- Implementing an infinite scrolling option on the movie page (may implement this once all features are completed)
Next steps:
- Improving design of existing pages (authentication pages, homepage, and questionnaire page)
- Reducing the fetching time of the /movies endpoint
- Enhancing basic content-based recommendation system to incorporate watchlist data and other features
- Creating recommendation feedback mechanism to verify recommendation quality
- Utilising more advanced algorithms/techniques beyond TF-IDF and cosine similarity
- Integrating NLP techniques into search functionality and recommendations

08/04/2025 
Activities:
- Resolved an issue on the movie page where movies couldn't be added to the watchlist.
- Introduced a visual "added" indicator on movie cards for movies added to the watchlist.
Challenges:
- Determining how to manage varying movie ID formats​
Next Steps:
- Develop and integrate a system for user reviews and feedback for recommendation

10/04/2025
Activities:
- Implemented concurrent request handling to prevent database deadlock during recommendation
- Allowed user to rate their recommendations based on whether they think its good or bad (for now)
Challenges:
- Handling race conditions between frontend and backend 
- Making sure locks are released during error conditions 
- Implementing proper timeouts for processes running for long 
- Managing asynchronous request states in React
Next Steps:
- Implement a more advanced search function 
- Improve UI for pages 
- Improve current recommendation system 

11/04/2025
Activities:
- Added search functionality to movie page, allowing users to search for movies 
- Redesigned the homepage to display popular movie and trending movies as well as making it consistent with other pages
- Prevented multiple api calls everytime a movie card loaded on screen which made things a lot slower 
Challenges 
- Fixing inconsistent responsive issue in the homepage 
- Resolving performance inssues with movie card and /watchlist endpoint 

12/04/2025 - 14/04/2025
Activities:
- Refactored the backend
- Enhancing the lock function for better error handling  
- Improving general error handling in most functions
Challenges

- Creating folders and files for each route for readability 
Next Steps:
- Start implementing advanced searhg functionality 
- Start improving current recommender system
- Improving design of homepage while maintaining consistent design

15/04/2025 – 01/05/2025
 Activities:
- Created a sophisticated recommender system that learns from users over time as they interact with the system  
- Created a recommendation explanation and insights page to give users more details on why certain movies were recommended  
- Created a disliked movies page where users can view their disliked movies  
- Created a user preference model that learns from user feedback  
- Added a feedback mechanism on the recommendation page allowing users to give overall feedback on the recommendations as well as movie-specific feedback  
- Improved the speed of the `/movies` endpoint and implemented caching to store the fetched movies  
- Fixed styling inconsistencies 
- Pushed and merged the master branch with main branch successfully 
 Challenges:
- Implementing a recommender system that learns from user behaviour  
- Using the watchlist as part of the recommendation process without causing problems  
- Preventing "filter bubbles" where users would be recommended movies too similar to what they already like, with no diversity in the suggestions  
- Balancing performance and precision for the `/movies` endpoint (the more pages traversed, the longer the fetch time and the more movies retrieved)  
- Implementing helpful explanation features that allow users to understand the recommender system and how it works without diving into the code  
 Next Steps:
- Prepare the codebase for final submission
